# Layout

When layout expresses relationships, people can see what to read and where to act. Group content by task, then choose a component that supports each group.

## Selection guidelines

| Situation                                              | Recommended choice       | Code                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| A row with a title, description, and supporting action | Content Row              | `<ContentRow>…</ContentRow>` |
| An input with a name, description, and error           | `Field`                  | `<Field>…</Field>`           |
| An independent information group                       | `Card`                   | `<Card>…</Card>`             |
| Short contextual choices                               | `Popover`, Dropdown Menu | `<Popover>…</Popover>`       |
| A focused task                                         | `Dialog`, `Drawer`       | `<Dialog>…</Dialog>`         |
| Results and comparable values                          | `Table`                  | `<Table>…</Table>`           |

### Width and spacing

Consider `sizeVars.contentSm` for a short input group and `contentMd` for reading areas. Keep the layout within the available width on narrow screens. Follow Spacing for gaps that communicate relationships.

### First-line alignment

Align Content Row titles and actions on their first baseline. Align `Checkbox` to the first title line when paired with `FieldContent`. A wrapping description should not require manual top or bottom padding.

### Narrow screens

Move secondary actions to the next row or a related menu when space is limited. Keep the primary action visible. Avoid fixed heights, overflowing widths, and horizontal scrolling as default solutions.

## Examples

### Compose a file list

Use Content Row to group a file name, modified time, and secondary action. Consider `Table` when people need to compare several values across items. The same data can need a different layout depending on whether the task is browsing or comparison.
