## Usage guidelines

### When to use

Use `Button` to submit, save, create, or change something in the current task. For navigation to another page or a downloadable resource, use a link. Use `Checkbox` or `Switch` to represent a persistent choice; a pressed-looking button alone does not explain that state.

### Choose the emphasis

| Variant       | Use for                                                        | Avoid                                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary`     | The next action that advances the task, such as Save           | Giving every action in a group equal emphasis               |
| `secondary`   | An alternative that should remain easy to find, such as Cancel | Treating the border as a reason to use it for every control |
| `ghost`       | Supporting actions in a row or toolbar with clear context      | Hiding the only way to complete the task in a dense screen  |
| `destructive` | An action that removes data or has a costly consequence        | Ordinary cancellation or a recoverable validation error     |

Start with one primary action per task area. A dialog is a separate task area, so its confirmation can be primary even when the underlying page has a primary action. Repeated rows usually need secondary or ghost actions so each row does not compete for attention.

### Choose the size and placement

Start with `md`, the default. Use `sm` for compact rows and toolbars; use `lg` when the surrounding form or layout calls for a larger control. Keep related buttons the same size. Increasing size is not a substitute for choosing the right emphasis.

Use `icon-xs`, `icon-sm`, `icon`, or `icon-lg` for an icon-only action, and provide `aria-label`. Prefer a text label when the icon's meaning is unfamiliar. A shape changes the outline, not the meaning of the action.

Keep actions beside the content they affect and use the same order across similar screens. Content Row handles the first-line alignment of its title and action; do not compensate for descriptions with manual vertical padding.

### Labels and processing

Name the action with a verb and, when needed, its object: “Save changes” or “Delete project”. In a form, set `type="submit"` for submission and `type="button"` for other actions explicitly.

> `Button` does not provide a `loading` prop. Manage the pending state in the application, prevent duplicate submission, and show a processing label or `Spinner` with a text status. Do not use a disabled button as the only explanation for why an action is unavailable.

### Content alignment

Use `align` to position button content: `start`, `center` (default), `end`, or
`space-between`. Start and end follow the writing direction. Give the button
more width than its content to make alignment visible. Use `space-between`
to place a label and trailing icon at opposite ends.
