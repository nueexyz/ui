## Usage guidelines

### When to use

Use `Combobox` when users select an item by narrowing a list with text, such as finding a person or project. Use [Select](?path=/docs/components-select--docs) when scanning the list is sufficient, or `Input` when the value is unrestricted text.

### Search is not selection

Distinguish the text being typed from the selected value. Do not promise that arbitrary text creates a new item: creation requires an explicit application flow. Keep option labels specific enough to distinguish similar names.

### Results and states

Use `ComboboxEmpty` for a completed search with no matches. If results come from a server, manage loading, failures, and stale responses in the application; an empty list does not explain all three. Preserve the query after a failure so the user can retry.

> Keep the input's accessible name separate from its placeholder. Verify keyboard selection and clearing as well as pointer selection. See [Search and Filter](?path=/docs/patterns-search-and-filter--docs) for results-page behavior.
