# Documentation translations

Document prose and reference descriptions support Korean and English. Navigation,
controls, and example code stay in English. Korean is the default locale.

- `content.ko.json`: Korean translations keyed by the Markdown passed to
  `LocalizedMarkdown`. Update the key and translation when the source changes.
- `reference.ko.json`: descriptions in token reference tables.
- `guidelines.md` and `guidelines.en.md` beside foundation, component, and pattern
  pages: paired guidance rendered from the same files used for AI exports.

## Editing guidance

Keep Foundations focused on shared decisions, component pages on choosing and
using the component, and Patterns on a working combination with explicit tradeoffs.
Put a rule in one place and link to it when another page needs the detail.

In Korean, use direct sentences with a clear subject or action. Prefer concrete
conditions over general advice, and explain a restriction only when it affects a
choice. Use “초점” consistently for focus and preserve API identifiers verbatim.
Keep the meaning aligned between languages; sentence structure need not match.
